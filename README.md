# Solving a problem on hacker rank, 3 levels

## Why?

[This challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/one-week-preparation-kit-plus-minus/problem?isFullScreen=true&h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=preparation-kits&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-week-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-week-day-one) sparked the code you see here.

I routinely get students who are job prepping and they get a challenge that they fail.

When this happens the come to me to see how I would code it. Instead of just showing them the answer I take them through a journy of good, better, best.

Enjoy.
